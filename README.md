Hi Everyone. 
This is the first repo in starting a career with data science. Here i have done a preprocessing of a dataset.
Raw Dataset is linked here in the name of framingham.csv for reference.

The Variable in the dataset explains about 


**Demographic:**

Sex: male or female(Nominal)

Age: Age of the patient;(Continuous - Although the recorded ages have been truncated to whole numbers, the concept of age is continuous)

Education: no further information provided


**Behavioral:**

Current Smoker: whether or not the patient is a current smoker (Nominal)

Cigs Per Day: the number of cigarettes that the person smoked on average in one day.(can be considered continuous as one can have any number of cigarettes, even half a cigarette.)

**Information on current medical condition:**

Tot Chol: total cholesterol level (Continuous)

Sys BP: systolic blood pressure (Continuous)

Dia BP: diastolic blood pressure (Continuous)

BMI: Body Mass Index (Continuous)

Heart Rate: heart rate (Continuous - In medical research, variables such as heart rate though in fact discrete, yet are considered continuous because of large number of possible values.)

Glucose: glucose level (Continuous)


**Target variable to predict:**

10 year risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) - (binary: “1”, means “Yes”, “0” means “No”)


Also Python code used for EDA is attached in the name of ML workshop Excersice.ipynb
